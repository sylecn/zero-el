zero-el provides zero-input-pinyin, an Emacs pinyin input method for Chinese
and zero-input-framework, which is an emacs Chinese input method framework.

* An introduction to zero-el, including how to install and config zero-el.
https://blog.emacsos.com/zero-el.html

For user configurable variables, see
M-x customize-group zero-input
M-x customize-group zero-input-pinyin

* Zero Pinyin Usage
- Enable zero-input minor mode in emacs buffer.
  M-x zero-input-mode

  You should bind a global hotkey for this function for easier switch, e.g.
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f1>") 'zero-input-mode)

- Type pinyin string, for example, "zhongwen", zero will show candidates
  matches this pinyin string. You may choose first candidate by space. You may
  choose other candidates by digit keys. You may page down, page up by =/-
  key.

  Some notes on pinyin string,
  - There is no ü on US keyboard, type v instead. For example lv 绿.
  - Use ' to separate pinyin substring like xi'an 西安

* Zero Framework features
- Chinese punctuation mapping. Type the char will insert the corresponding
  Chinese punctuation when zero-input-punctuation-level is basic or full.

  | char    | punctuation    |
  |---------+----------------|
  | =basic= |                |
  | ,       | ，             |
  | .       | 。             |
  | ?       | ？             |
  | !       | ！             |
  | \       | 、             |
  | :       | ：             |
  | =full=  |                |
  | _       | ——             |
  | < >     | 《 》          |
  | ( )     | （ ）          |
  | [ ]     | 【 】          |
  | ^       | ……             |
  | " "     | “ ”            |
  | ' '     | ‘ ’            |
  | ~       | ～             |
  | ;       | ；             |
  | $       | ￥             |
  | `       | · (middle dot) |

  You may customize punctuation mapping via
  zero-input-convert-punctuation-basic and zero-input-punctuation-full-map.
- Auto save user phrases. When you type a new phrase, it will be remembered in
  user phrase db.
- To delete system phrase or user phrase, type C-<digit> when candidate is
  shown in zero-panel.
- Auto convert Chinese period to dot for digits and English letter and digit
  mixed words. For example, to type "3.6" when zero-input-mode is on, type
  "3." will insert "3。", just continue type 6, it will be converted to
  "3.6". Same thing for "H。265" -> "H.265".
